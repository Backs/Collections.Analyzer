# CI0007: Method Any() is used on concurrent collection
Method `Any()` is much slower on concurrent collections than `IsEmpty` property.
Using collection initializer without capacity harms performance and cause additional memory allocation.

## Examples
```csharp
var bag = new ConcurrentBag<string>(new[] { "a", "b", "c" });

var hasAny = bag.Any();
```
```csharp
var bag = new ConcurrentBag<string>(new[] { "a", "b", "c" });

var hasAny = !bag.IsEmpty;
```
